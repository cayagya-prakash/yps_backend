  "content": "<p><br></p><h2 style=\"line-height: 1.3em\"><strong>1. The “Must-Carry” Document Bag</strong></h2><p>Do not leave this for Monday morning. Pack this bag <strong>tonight</strong>.</p><ul><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><strong>Admit Card (Physical Copy):</strong> Print two copies. Keep both in your bag, one for use and the other as a backup. Do not rely on your phone; phones are deposited outside.</li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><strong>Government ID:</strong> Aadhar Card, Voter ID, or Driving License. The name must match your Admit Card.</li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><strong>Two Passport Size Photos:</strong> Sometimes, the photo on the printed Admit Card is blurry. Invigilators can be fussy. Carry spares just in case.</li></ul><h2 style=\"line-height: 1.3em\"><strong>2. Stationery Hacks (The “Field Experience”)</strong></h2><p>You aren’t just writing an exam; you are fighting a battle against time. Your weapons matter.</p><ul><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><strong>Calculators (Yes, Plural):</strong> Carry <strong>two</strong> calculators of the same model.<ul><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><em>Why?</em> We have seen batteries die in the middle of an SFM paper. It is a nightmare you don’t want to live.</li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><em>Tip:</em> Ensure you are comfortable with the keys. Don’t buy a brand-new model today that feels foreign to your fingers.</li></ul></li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><strong>Black Ballpoint Pens:</strong> ICAI is strict about this. No blue, no gel.<ul><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><em>Mentor’s Take:</em> Do not take a fresh packet of pens. Take pens that are 80% full. They write smoother and don’t blot.</li></ul></li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><strong>Pencil &amp; Eraser:</strong> For MCQs and ruling formats.</li></ul><h2 style=\"line-height: 1.3em\"><strong>3. The “Survival Kit” (Non-Obvious Essentials)</strong></h2><p>This is where the advice comes in. These items save you from unnecessary stress.</p><ul><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><strong>Transparent Water Bottle:</strong> Most centres now strictly forbid non-transparent bottles. If you have a fancy metal flask, they will make you leave it outside. Buy a generic clear plastic bottle.</li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><strong>Analog Watch:</strong> Smartwatches are strictly banned. Wall clocks in exam centres are notoriously unreliable or positioned where you can’t see them. Wear a simple analog watch to track your 15-minute reading time.</li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><strong>The Jacket/Sweater:</strong> “But it’s January!” Exactly. But also, some centres have ACs blasting or drafty windows. Shivering while trying to balance a Balance Sheet is impossible. Layer up.</li></ul><h2 style=\"line-height: 1.3em\"><strong>4. The Mentor’s Take: The “1:45 PM” Strategy</strong></h2><p><em>The most crucial 15 minutes of your life.</em></p><p>When you get that paper at 1:45 PM (for the 2:00 PM start), your heart will race.</p><ol><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><strong>Don’t read Question 1 first.</strong> It is usually the toughest and is designed to panic you.</li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\">Scan the paper for the “Easy Kill” questions.</li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\">Plan your order of attack.</li></ol><p><strong>A Note on Anxiety:</strong><strong><br></strong>If you feel overwhelmed, remember why you started. Visualise the end goal. Visualise yourself two months from now, using the <a href=\"https://tools.camonk.com/salary-estimator\"><strong>Salary Estimator</strong></a> to negotiate your first package, or updating your profile on our <a href=\"https://tools.camonk.com/resume-builder\"><strong>Resume Builder</strong></a> with those two magical letters “CA” before your name. Keep that image in your head.</p><h2 style=\"line-height: 1.3em\"><strong>5. Last Minute Advice: 1 Hour Before</strong></h2><ul><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><strong>Stop Studying:</strong> at 1:00 PM, close the book. Cramming now only overwrites what you stored in your long-term memory.</li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><strong>Avoid the “Discussion Circle”:</strong> You know that group of students outside the centre discussing “Is AS-11 important?” Stay away from them. They radiate panic. Put on your headphones.</li><li style=\"font-size: 16px\"><strong>Hydrate, but not too much:</strong> You don’t want bathroom breaks eating into your writing time.</li></ul><h2 style=\"line-height: 1.3em\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>You have done the work. Now, trust your preparation. Whether this is your first attempt or you are fighting back after a setback, remember that this exam tests your nerves as much as your knowledge.</p><p>Good luck for Jan 5th. You’ve got this!</p>",
